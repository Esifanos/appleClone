                    1. Trade In: Trade‑in values vary. iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro
                    promotional pricing is after trade‑in of iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X
                    in good condition. Additional trade‑in values require purchase of a
                    new iPhone, subject to availability and limits. Must be at least 18.
                    Apple or its trade-in partners reserve the right to refuse or limit
                    any Trade In transaction for any reason. In‑store trade‑in requires
                    presentation of a valid, government-issued photo ID (local law may
                    require saving this information). Sales tax may be assessed on full
                    value of new iPhone. Additional terms from Apple or Apple’s trade-in
                    partners may apply. Monthly pricing: Available to qualified
                    customers and requires 0% APR, 24‑month installment loan with
                    Citizens One, and iPhone activation with AT&T, Sprint, T‑Mobile, or
                    Verizon.
